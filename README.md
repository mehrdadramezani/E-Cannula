# E-Cannula reveals anatomical diversity in sharp-wave ripples
This repository hosts the codes for decoding spatiotemporal characteristics of SWRs from the activity of cell assemblies imaged in the CA1 region of mice.

## Usage Guide
1. Example LFP data (100 seconds) can be used to check the code
2. Longer data is needed for the clustering and classification, and preferably a combined dataset from multiple sessions
3. Please contact us for help with code implementation.
